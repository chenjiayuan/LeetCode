Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

It helps to see the digital root of a positive integer as the position it holds with respect 
to the largest multiple of 9 less than it. For example, the digital root of 11 is 2, which means 
that 11 is the second number after 9. Likewise, the digital root of 2035 is 1, which means that 
2035 âˆ’ 1 is a multiple of 9. If a number produces a digital root of exactly 9, then the number 
is a multiple of 9.
