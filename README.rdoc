== LeetCode
Those are my solutions to the interview question proposed on LeetCode online judging platform (https://leetcode.com). 

In order to improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures, I will also post trivial ideas on each question, or maybe multiple solutions to the same one. Although these stuffs are still challenging for me, I will keep working hard and never give up!

For now, the solutions are consist with Java, C, and Ruby. Those are the three languages that I am most familiar with (or willing to learn). Appreciate your review and comments!

Update 9/5/2015:
I've modified the organization of the problems. Problem descriptions are now in Solution.java. Because I am mainly focusing on solve problems in Java, due to the limited time frame.
